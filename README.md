# JavaScript Essential Training

This is the modified repository for the LinkedIn Learning course JavaScript Essential Training.
For this set of examples, I've stepped through the initial scripts and added custom code to highlight the various features and use of JS for study. These code examples can be used in production environments as links to MDN included in the comment sections to help explain objectives along with my own notes in the comment section per commits.

JavaScript is a scripting language of the web. As the web evolves from a static to a dynamic environment, technology focus is shifting from static markup and styling—frequently handled by content management systems or automated scripts—to dynamic interfaces and advanced interaction. Once seen as optional, JavaScript is now becoming an integral part of the web, infusing every layer with its script.

Through practical examples and mini-projects, this course helps you build your understanding of JavaScript piece by piece, from core principles like variables, data types, conditionals, and functions through advanced topics including loops, and DOM scripting. Along the way, instructor Morten Rand-Hendriksen provides challenges that allow you to put your new skills to the test.

## Instructions

This repository does not have any branches. Download the entire repository and you get the exercise files in their final state.

Each folder corresponds with a movie with an exercise file. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_FOLDER#`. As an example, the folder named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third lecture in that chapter.

Some examples will have a beginning and an end state - I've worked thru all the 'final' logic using the 'starter' files so you can compare to the actual 'end' files (optional). In the exercise files, the end-state for a file / folder is marked with an `e` for "end" as in `02_03e`. This folder contains the code as it is at the end of the, default, configurations.

## Installing

1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
   - A code editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended)
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
